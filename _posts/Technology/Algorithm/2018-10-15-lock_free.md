### Lock-Free Data Structures

[Lock-Free Data Structures](http://www.drdobbs.com/lock-free-data-structures/184401865) 要点如下

1. In classic lock-based programming, whenever you need to share some data, you need to serialize access to it. 
2. what's that "small set of things" that you can do atomically in lock-free programming? In fact, what would be the minimal set of atomic primitives that would allow implementing any lock-free algorithm—if there's such a set?
3. Herlihy (http://www.podc.org/dijkstra/2003.html) proves which primitives are good and which are bad for building lock-free data structures. That brought some seemingly hot hardware architectures to instant obsolescence, while clarifying what synchronization primitives should be implemented in future hardware.
4. For example, Herlihy's paper gave impossiblity results, showing that atomic operations such as test-and-set, swap, fetch-and-add, or even atomic queues (!) are insufficient for properly synchronizing more than two threads. 
3. On the bright side, Herlihy also gave universality results, proving that some simple constructs are enough for implementing any lock-free algorithm for any number of threads.The simplest and most popular universal primitive, is the compare-and-swap (CAS) operation
4.  Compiler 和 cpu 经常搞一些  optimizations，这种单线程视角下的优化在多线程环境下是不合时宜的，为此要用 memory barriers 来禁止  Compiler 和 cpu 搞这些小动作。 For purposes here, I assume that the compiler and the hardware don't introduce funky optimizations (such as eliminating some "redundant" variable reads, a valid optimization under a single-thread assumption). Technically, that's called a "sequentially consistent" model in which reads and writes are performed and seen in the exact order in which the source code does them. 这里假定代码是什么顺序，实际执行就是什么顺序。



一个无锁的map

1. Reads have no locking at all.
2. Updates make a copy of the entire map, update the copy, and then try to CAS it with the old map. While the CAS operation does not succeed, the copy/update/CAS process is tried again in a loop.
3. Because CAS is limited in how many bytes it can swap, WRRMMap stores the Map as a pointer and not as a direct member of WRRMMap.


代码


	// 1st lock-free implementation of WRRMMap
	// Works only if you have GC
	template <class K, class V>
	class WRRMMap {
	   Map<K, V>* pMap_;
	public:
	   V Lookup (const K& k) {
	      //Look, ma, no lock
	      return (*pMap_) [k];
	   }
	   void Update(const K& k,
	         const V& v) {
	      Map<K, V>* pNew = 0;
	      do {
	         Map<K, V>* pOld = pMap_;
	         delete pNew;
	         pNew = new Map<K, V>(*pOld);
	         (*pNew) [k] = v;
	      } while (!CAS(&pMap_, pOld, pNew));
	      // DON'T delete pMap_;
	   }
	};

先证明 做到了 哪些primitives 便可以支持 无锁编程  ==> 推动硬件支持 ==> 基于硬件支持实现无锁数据结构与算法。

## 小结

其实多线程竞争 从lock-based 演化为 lock-free ，消息通信。
io 通信从bio 也演化为 reactor 模式，也是事件通知 这里面有点意思
